_Sodalite_ is a [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) plugin for *[Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450540/Hot_Dogs_Horseshoes__Hand_Grenades/)* (known as H3VR) which provides tools and modding APIs for the game.

## What's in this plugin
- BepInEx log panel, accessible from the wrist menu
- Some API code to allow easier interfacing with various parts of the game including firearms, Steam leaderboards, lockable panels, the player, the vault, and the wrist menu.
- (WIP) UI Widgets system to fill custom panels with programatically generated layouts
- Various smaller extension methods and classes to assist in the development of plugins for H3VR
