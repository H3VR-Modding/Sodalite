## What is Sodalite?
Sodalite provides modding APIs and tools for the game _Hot Dogs, Horseshoes &
Handgrenades_. [It's also a cool blue rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodalite).

In addition to being a modding API, Sodalite also contains a couple extra useful
tools such as a spawnable log panel. This documentation website will mostly focus on
the API, however.

## Why does Sodalite exist?
All modding APIs share the same purpose: to provide abstractions for interfacing
with the game and it's systems. This has a number of advantages, such as reducing
repeated code across multiple mods and making all of those actions happen
consistently which means less potential incompatibilities.
